# app-directory-program-
This program is similar to any apple or android app search program contained in the app store. The program reads through a csv file 
that contains a database of apps with the apps category, rating, number of reviews, purchase price, and number of installs. The user 
can input the name of the app they are looking for and the app, with all of its information, should be printed out.
